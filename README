		      MATE Color Manager
	       Color profile manager for the MATE desktop

MATE Color Manager is a session framework that makes it easy to manage, install
and generate color profiles in the MATE desktop.

This project has the following features:

* Setting output gamma tables (with local brightness and adjustments) to any
  Xrandr output (falling back to the per-screen methods for drivers that do not
  yet support Xrandr 1.3).

* Setting of settings at session start, and when monitors are hotplugged.

* Easy install of vendor supplied ICC or ICM files, just by double clicking
  on the file.

* Easy display calibration using an external calibration device, and scanner
  calibration using a inexpensive IT 8.7 target. For calibration, the ArgyllCMS
  package is required.

* Integration X11 by setting the per-screen and per-output _ICC_PROFILE atom,
  which makes applications such as the GIMP use a color managed output.

* Easy to use DBus interface for applications to query what ICC profiles should
  be used for a specific device or device type. This is session activated and
  is only started when it is needed, and quits after a small period of idleness.
